## _Why_?

`Go` is a great programming language
if you want a good balance between simplicity,
beginner-friendliness (_being able to find/train new team members_)
and high performance.

## _What_?

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language
designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
Go is syntactically similar to C,
but with memory safety,
garbage collection,
structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency
The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.
~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)

## _Who_?

Anyone who wants to broaden their programming skills should learn `Go`.
The syntax is immediately familiar to anyone who has written a `C`-style
language such as `JavaScript`.

## _How_?

You can learn the basics of `Go` online: https://play.golang.org
But when it comes time to actually _run_ a program
on your computer, you will need to install the compiler.
Visit:
https://golang.org/doc/install
and select the installer for your operating system.

### Hello World!

> Following: https://golang.org/doc/install#testing

Create a new file called `hello.go`
and type the following code in it:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
}
```

Once you've saved the file,
in your terminal,
compile the programming
with the following command:

```sh
go build hello.go
```

That will create an _executable_ file called `hello` (_with no extension_)
To _execute_ the program,
run the command:

```
./hello
```

In your terminal, you should see:

```
hello, world
```

Congratulations you just wrote your first Go program!

## Popularity?

Despite the simplicity and performance of `Go`,
it's nowhere _near_ as used/known
as Google would like you to believe.
For example it's not in the Top 10 languages on GitHub:
https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages
<img width="1171" alt="github-most-popular-languages" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/87814203-2d8cc200-c85b-11ea-8229-c5d1b4dae2d4.png">

And it's used by fewer than 9% of developers (_who answered the survey_)
on StackOverflow.
https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology
<img width="802" alt="stackoverflow-dev-survey-languages" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/87814783-4c3f8880-c85c-11ea-9b2a-c7e1c068491e.png">

Don't let these stats dissuade you.
The biggest reason `Go` is not as popular as `JavaScript`, `Python` or `PHP`
is simply because the other languages got a _massive_ head start.

Go usually scores well on synthetic benchmarks:
https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks
We know from experience that Postgres is usually the bottleneck in our Apps,
so the programming language doesn't matter quite as much you think.
What matters is having a sane approach to concurrency and channels
for building the features your people want.

### Why _Not_?

Common complaints/gripes developers have with `Go` include:

- Error handling - this can be quite tedious
  see: https://medium.com/rungo/error-handling-in-go-f0125de052f0
- Code duplication - some people complain about the lack of **inheritance** leading to code duplication.
- Lack of [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) can mean less extensibility.
- Operator overloading - a lack of
  [operator overloading](http://www.golangpatterns.info/object-oriented/operators)
  can lead to more terse code.

We feel all the issues (_with the exception of error handling_)
are actually _features_ of Go that lead to simpler more maintainable code.

> As noted in ["Why Elixir"](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102) > `Go` is our 3rd Choice for programming languages.
> We use `Elixir` because Phoenix Channels makes Real Time _easy_
> and `Nerves` makes building, deploying and maintaining IoT a _breeze_.
> If `Elixir` didn't exist it would be a choice between `Rust` and `Go`.
> `Go` is a _lot_ simpler and beginner-friendly.
> `Rust` is "safer" and more performant.

## Imports

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

Or
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)
```

## Packages

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package `main`.

This program is using the packages with import paths "fmt" and "math/rand".

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

## Basic types

Go's basic types are:

- bool
- string
- int  int8  int16  int32  int64
- uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr
- byte // alias for uint8
- rune // alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point
- float32 float64
- complex64 complex128

The example shows variables of several types, and also that variable declarations may be "factored" into blocks, as with import statements.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/cmplx"
)

var (
	ToBe   bool       = false
	MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
	z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
	fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

The int, uint, and uintptr types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use int unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type. 


## Variables

The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
	var i int
	fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```


### Variables with initializers

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
	var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
	fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}
```

### Short variable declarations

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type. 

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available. 

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i, j int = 1, 2
	k := 3
	c, python, java := true, false, "no!"

	fmt.Println(i, j, k, c, python, java)
}
```

## Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type `int`.

Notice that the type comes after the variable name.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

### Functions continued

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

In this example, we shortened

```go
x int, y int
```

to

```go
x, y int
```

### Multiple results

A function can return any number of results.

The swap function returns two strings.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
	return y, x
}

func main() {
	a, b := swap("hello", "world")
	fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

## Zero values

Variables declared without an explicit initial value are given their zero value.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var i int
	var f float64
	var b bool
	var s string
	fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
```

The zero value is:

- `0` for numeric types,
- `false` for the boolean type, and
- `""` (the empty string) for strings.
